Short description
-----------------
P4 is a recipe finder web application.

In the open (unregistered version) the user can type some ingredients and get 
back some recipe recommendations, which he/she can refresh.

In the signed up version the user has also the chance to store (and delete
of course) his/her recipes, as well as rating them.

My initial expectations of this project was to include much more functionality 
and control to the recipe choice, however due to time constraints that was not
possible so it came out to be a fairly simple web application.

Notes for TA
------------

The project uses an external API to get the recipes. A dedicated class is 
implemented that works as a proxy to the yummly API that is used to obtain the 
recipes.
